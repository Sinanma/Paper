what packages in R included function beep

ChatGPT
In R, the function beep() is primarily found in the beepr package. 
The beepr package is designed to make it easy to play notification 
sounds on either Windows, macOS, or Linux systems. It can be used 
to play a sound after a long script finishes running, for example, 
or to indicate that an error has occurred. This makes it particularly 
useful for long-running analyses, providing an auditory signal that a 
task has completed or needs attention. The package includes a variety 
of sounds that can be played by specifying different arguments to the 
beep() function.

what packages in R have included function read_csv

ChatGPT
The read_csv function is a popular way to import CSV files into R, 
provided by several packages designed for data manipulation and analysis. 
Two prominent packages that include a read_csv function are:
  readr package: Part of the tidyverse, readr is designed for fast and 
easy data import in R, including reading CSV files. The read_csv function 
in readr is optimized for speed and usability, automatically parsing file 
types and handling missing values. It tends to be faster than the base R 
functions for reading CSV files and provides more informative error messages.
data.table package: Although data.table is primarily known for its 
high-performance data manipulation capabilities, it also includes the fread 
function, which serves a similar purpose to read_csv. While not named read_csv,
fread is highly efficient for reading large CSV files and automatically detects
the delimiter, making it a powerful alternative for importing CSV data.

modelsummary::modelsummary(

  ),
  statistic = "mad",
  fmt = 2
) this is my code and when I want to render to pdf and it shows "Error: `modelsummary could not extract the required information from a model of
  class "rowwise_df". The package tried a sequence of 2 helper functions
  to extract estimates:
  
  parameters::parameters(model)
  broom::tidy(model)
  
  To draw a table, one of these commands must return a `data.frame` with a
  column named "term". The `modelsummary` website explains how to
  summarize unsupported models or add support for new models yourself:

  These errors messages were generated during extraction:
  
  `parameters::parameters(model)` did not return a valid data.frame.
`broom::tidy(model)` did not return a data.frame with a `term` column." how do I solve it?
  
ChatGPT
The error you're encountering suggests that the modelsummary package is unable 
to extract the necessary information from the model object you're providing 
because it is of class rowwise_df. This class type indicates that your model 
object isn't directly supported by the modelsummary package's automated methods
for extracting model summaries, which rely on either the parameters::parameters(model) or 
broom::tidy(model) functions to retrieve a data frame with at least a column named "term" 
representing model terms.

To solve this issue, consider the following approaches:

  Check Model Object: Ensure that the model object (toronto_shelters_data_first_model_rstanarm) is 
correctly specified and represents a model estimation result. If it's mistakenly 
wrapped or transformed into a rowwise_df, you may need to correct the way you're 
generating or storing the model output.

Manual Extraction and Summary: If automatic extraction fails, you can manually extract the necessary summary statistics from your model object and construct a data frame that modelsummary can accept. This data frame must include a column named "term" for model terms and any other relevant columns for statistics like estimates, standard errors, confidence intervals, etc. Here's a generic approach:
Use appropriate methods to extract model summaries directly from your rstanarm model. Functions like summary(model) or print(model) for rstanarm objects might help.
Construct a data frame from the extracted summaries, ensuring it has a "term" column and any other columns for the statistics you wish to display.
Use this data frame with modelsummary to create your table.

Custom Model Support: If you frequently work with models that modelsummary does not natively support, consider implementing custom support as suggested in the error message. The modelsummary website provides guidance on how to summarize unsupported models or add new models. This often involves writing a custom method for the tidy function from the broom package or the parameters function from the parameters package that can handle your specific model class.

nsult Documentation: Both the rstanarm and modelsummary documentation may offer additional insights or examples for handling rstanarm models. There might be specific steps or considerations for these types of models that are not immediately apparent.

If you're still having trouble after these steps, please provide more details about how you're fitting the model with rstanarm and any specific requirements for the summary statistics you need. This information can help in suggesting a more targeted solution.
